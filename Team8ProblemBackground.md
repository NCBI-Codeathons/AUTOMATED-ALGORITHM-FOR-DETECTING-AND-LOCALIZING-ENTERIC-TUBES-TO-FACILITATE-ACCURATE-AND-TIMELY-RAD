Complications related to feeding tube placement

“Most frequent are those involving inadvertent placement into the respiratory tract, primarily because blind tube insertions may easily take the wrong course into the trachea instead of the esophagus”
“National Patient Safety Agency in the United Kingdom issued a safety alert in 2005 regarding misplaced naso and orogastric feeding tubes in babies in neonatal units [5]. Similarly, the Joint Commission of Healthcare Organizations in the United States has identified nasogastric feeding tube insertion into the trachea or bronchus as a sentinel event”

“We found that clinical indicators of proper tube placement (such as auscultation over the stomach of air injected into the tube) were unreliable.” 
“We require a chest roentgenogram prior to the initiation of feeding. However, the interpretation of a radiograph in critically ill patients can be difficult. As in previous studies, we observed errors in interpretation which resulted in significant morbidity [6,14]. One of our patient deaths was directly attributable to the initiation of feeding after a tube was misinterpreted as being in proper position on the chest roentgenogram.”
“To decrease the inherent risks, it is advisable to have only trained operators perform this procedure.” 
“There have been several strategies suggested to avoid inadvertent tracheopulmonary placement of enteral feeding tubes. These have included fluoroscopy, laryngoscopy and endoscopy-guided insertion [9,12,14]. All of these techniques would increase cost and time for insertion and require the availability of specialist assistance. Insertion of the enteral feeding tube without the stylet is difficult.”

“Currently, at our institution, we have implemented a guideline concerning the placement of small-bore feeding tubes in vulnerable patients. At-risk patients are defined as those who are intubated; have tracheostomies; are neurologically impaired; have an altered mental status impairing their ability to protect their airway; are determined, for any reason, to be unable to protect their airway; or have anatomical abnormalities that could preclude the safe passage of a feeding tube. In this patient population, it is required that the tip of the feeding tube be visualized directly, endoscopically, or radiographically as it passes from the nose to the esophageal inlet.”
Enhancing patient safety during feeding-tube insertion: a review of more than 2,000 insertions
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16931614
“Of all small-bore nasogastric feeding-tube placements, 1.3%-2.4% resulted in 50 documented cases of feeding-tube malpositions during 4 years. Over half of the 50 patients were mechanically ventilated, and only 2 had a normal mental status. There were 13 complications (26% of malpositions), including 2 deaths, which were directly attributed to the feeding-tube malposition. Only 2 of the 13 complications and none of the misplacements had been recorded in the risk management database”
“Unassisted feeding tube insertion carries significant risk in vulnerable patients, which can be mitigated. Voluntary reporting appears inadequate to capture complications from feeding tube insertion.”
