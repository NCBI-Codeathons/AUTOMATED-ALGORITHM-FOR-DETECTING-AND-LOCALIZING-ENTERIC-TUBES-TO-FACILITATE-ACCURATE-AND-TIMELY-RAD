* Complications related to feeding tube placement
	* https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00001574-200703000-00013
	* “Most frequent are those involving inadvertent placement into the respiratory tract, primarily because blind tube insertions may easily take the wrong course into the trachea instead of the esophagus”
“National Patient Safety Agency in the United Kingdom issued a safety alert in 2005 regarding misplaced naso and orogastric feeding tubes in babies in neonatal units [5]. Similarly, the Joint Commission of Healthcare Organizations in the United States has identified nasogastric feeding tube insertion into the trachea or bronchus as a sentinel event”
	* Radiography remains the
gold standard for determining feeding tube location
* A prospective study of tracheopulmonary complications associated with the placement of narrow-bore enteral feeding tubes

	* “We found that clinical indicators of proper tube placement (such as auscultation over the stomach of air injected into the tube) were unreliable.” 
“We require a chest roentgenogram prior to the initiation of feeding. However, the interpretation of a radiograph in critically ill patients can be difficult. As in previous studies, we observed errors in interpretation which resulted in significant morbidity [6,14]. One of our patient deaths was directly attributable to the initiation of feeding after a tube was misinterpreted as being in proper position on the chest roentgenogram.”
“To decrease the inherent risks, it is advisable to have only trained operators perform this procedure.” 
“There have been several strategies suggested to avoid inadvertent tracheopulmonary placement of enteral feeding tubes. These have included fluoroscopy, laryngoscopy and endoscopy-guided insertion [9,12,14]. All of these techniques would increase cost and time for insertion and require the availability of specialist assistance. Insertion of the enteral feeding tube without the stylet is difficult.”

	* “Currently, at our institution, we have implemented a guideline concerning the placement of small-bore feeding tubes in vulnerable patients. At-risk patients are defined as those who are intubated; have tracheostomies; are neurologically impaired; have an altered mental status impairing their ability to protect their airway; are determined, for any reason, to be unable to protect their airway; or have anatomical abnormalities that could preclude the safe passage of a feeding tube. In this patient population, it is required that the tip of the feeding tube be visualized directly, endoscopically, or radiographically as it passes from the nose to the esophageal inlet.”
* Enhancing patient safety during feeding-tube insertion: a review of more than 2,000 insertions

	* “Of all small-bore nasogastric feeding-tube placements, 1.3%-2.4% resulted in 50 documented cases of feeding-tube malpositions during 4 years. Over half of the 50 patients were mechanically ventilated, and only 2 had a normal mental status. There were 13 complications (26% of malpositions), including 2 deaths, which were directly attributed to the feeding-tube malposition. Only 2 of the 13 complications and none of the misplacements had been recorded in the risk management database”
“Unassisted feeding tube insertion carries significant risk in vulnerable patients, which can be mitigated. Voluntary reporting appears inadequate to capture complications from feeding tube insertion.”

### Case Study



### Patient Statistics

* “Of all small-bore nasogastric feeding-tube placements, 1.3%-2.4% resulted in 50 documented cases of feeding-tube malpositions during 4 years. Over half of the 50 patients were mechanically ventilated, and only 2 had a normal mental status. There were 13 complications (26% of malpositions), including 2 deaths, which were directly attributed to the feeding-tube malposition. Only 2 of the 13 complications and none of the misplacements had been recorded in the risk management database”


### Clinical Perspectives

* What are the barriers to reviewing every enteric tube x-ray scan?
	* Time
		* Protocol is to read within the hour
	* Lack of information coming from doctor requesting
		* Every scan comes with requisition
		* Order request from entering physician
		* Finding enteric tubes misplaced even when order request does not specify
		* “Abdominal pain”
	* Difficult to document
		* Ex: tube is present 
		* So many tubes and lines that can make identification
		* Drainage tubes
		* Chest tubes
		* EKG leads
		* Vascular catheters
* How much time does it take you to review an enteric tube placement
	* Less than a minute
* What other tasks take priority over reviewing enteric tube placement
	* Answering phone calls
	* Reading high-priority CTs
	* Fluoroscopy studies
		* Leave room 
* Are there any other better imaging procedures for enteric tube placement?
	* MRI/CT/Ultrasound
	* Other imaging procedures too expensive and take too long
	* X-rays can be done quickly
* How are misplaced enteric tubes reported?
	* Give practitioners a call
	* Malpositioned
	* Sub-optimal
		* Referred to in report
		* >5cm beyond the GE junction
		* Too short may cause aspiration
		* Too long gets coiled
* How well-equipped are different clinical workers to detect misplacement?
	* Many people trained
	* Nurses place tubes
* When are you called in to review an enteric tube misplacement?
	* Shows on the PACS
	* Picture Archiving and Communication System
	* Image viewer for DICOMs
	* System for reading radiology studies
* What is the process for reviewing a scan?
	* Trace tube
	* Finding tube starting point and tracing through to tip
	* Wires make it difficult


## Needs Statement

#### Problem
A more time-efficient and accurate means of detecting misplaced and sub-optimal enteric tube placement

####Population

Intubated patients, especially with altered mental states or an inability to protect their airways

#### Outcome

Misplaced enteric tubes rates with scans provided will drop to 0 cases
Radiologists will be able to use their time more efficiently
Cite specific time savings and cost savings
Immediate feedback on enteric tube placement
Sub-optimal tube placement can be remedied and addressed immediately
